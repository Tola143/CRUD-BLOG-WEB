# CRUD-BLOG-WEB
Final project for BigData subject

This website provides a convenient and accessible way for people to explore new places and travel with potential partners, and upload their blogs as personal experiences. Not only a family trip, but also a friend's trip as well. To operate this website EJS, CSS and JavaScript have been used as front-end developing languages and NodeJs has been used as back-end developing API. Lastly, mongoDB has been used as a web database. Therefore, the aforementioned back-end and front-end are required to work perfectly.
